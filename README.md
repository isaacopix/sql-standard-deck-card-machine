Standard Deck of Cards Schema and Python Verifier

Objective
This project implements a SQL database schema for a standard deck of cards, including tracking functionality and player interactions.
I also include a Python verifier to test the schema and its functionality. 

1. The SQL code defines the schema for:
   - Ranks (`Rank` table)
   - Suits (`Suit` table)
   - Cards (`Card` table)
   - Player tracking (`Player`, `Player_Cards`, and `Track_Card` tables)
     
2. The Python Verifier implements automated tests to verify the correctness and functionality of the schema using SQLite.
